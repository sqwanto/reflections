>> When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

> There's a lot of reasons why someone would want to use a remote repository as opposed to keeping all your work local.  It
serves as backup in case you have a hardwear issue.  It also allows you easier access in case you are working from a 
different computer.  Finally, remote repositories also allow other people to work on projects more easily.

>> Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

> You or someone else might still be working on the code in a commit, so you might not get the full changes from that commit if Git pulled it automatically.

>> Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

> Forks can only be used with existing repositories on Github.  Therefore, they're mainly used when you're working on somebody elses project.  Clones are similar to forks except that you can clone Github repositories that are stored online to your local machine so that you can work on them locally.  Finally branches are aspects of repositories that allow for you to experiment with changes.

>> What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?

> Having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally saves you the work of having to pull or merge any new commits from Github.
